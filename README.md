# Tmag3001-implementation-on-STM32-Nucleo083RC
STM32 Nucleo-64 (STM32U083RC) Board with TMAG3001 3D Hall-Effect Sensor Integration. This code is designed to interface with the Texas Instruments TMAG3001 magnetic field sensor via the I2C bus. It initializes and configures the sensor and continuously reads and processes magnetic field data (X, Y, Z axes). The measured magnetic field values are output in milliTeslas (mT) via the serial port (UART). An I2C bus scan function is also included for debugging and device detection purposes.

After completing preparing the ioc file, select project from the menu bar and click the "Generate Code", it will prepare the .c files and paste and modify the needed part of my code, it is left to your choice but not modifying anything might led to errors and exceptions. Be sure to set the I2C address correctly
